This cipher functions by using a predetermined book and using the order of words present in the book to make a message of numbers that represent said words. Basically, the numbers in the ciphertext represent what place that word is in the order of words in a book. For every word encrypted, there are three numbers that represent it. The first, being the page number; the second, being the line number; and third, being the number on that line.
