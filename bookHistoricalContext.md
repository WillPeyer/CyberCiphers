Probably the most common cipher, it was used in The American Revolution, after the Revolution with one of the Beale Ciphers using the Declaration of Independance as a key to find treasure and the 2 others having not been cracked yet to this day, and even in Sherlock Holmes as one of the mysteries. One version of the cipher is entails a running code, or non-repeating, and is considered by many to be unbreakable, due to the lack of pattern or repeating variables within the code.
